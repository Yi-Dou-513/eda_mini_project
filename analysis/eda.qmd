library(tidyverse)
crime_data <- read_csv("data/Crime_Incidents_in_2025.csv")
crime_data <- crime_data |>

This project uses administrative crime data from Washington, DC (@dc_crime_2025). The time period represented by the data is from 2025-01-01 to 2026-01-01. The data were collected through administrative records from the Metropolitan Police Department based on reported crime incidents. Each observation represents a single reported crime incident and can be uniquely identified using the Crime Control Number (CCN). The data set is administrative and cross-sectional data including numeric, categorical, timeseries and geospatial variables. It does not include weights.
